"""numerics-lab ADOPTS the family rules registry: every rule is enforced here by a named mechanism, or absent.

``dev_lab.dev.rules`` holds the one canonical statement of each rule; ``assert_adopted`` resolves every
rule claimed here against a TRACKED mechanism in this tree and refuses a rule neither claimed nor declared
absent. It proves the accounting, not that the mechanisms pass -- that is the suite's business.

numerics-lab is a LIBRARY on the family branch flow: lanes merge into ``integrate/main``, and ``main`` moves
by ``integrate promote`` on a full forge PASS.
